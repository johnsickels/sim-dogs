## Overview

Create a single-page application that allows a user to:
- Search for a specific breed of dog.
- If the search field is empty, display a list of the first 12 breeds available, sorted alpha-
betically.
- If the search field does not match any breeds, display a message that no breeds were found.
- While the list of breeds is loading, display a message that the breeds are loading.
- Select one of the matching results and view pictures of that breed.
- When a result is selected, mark the selection visually as being active.
- While the images of the selected breed are loading, display a message that the images are loading.
